## Illusion
Back and better than ever (hopefully)

## Info
A 'ghost' cheat client for Forge 1.8.9.

This is a full rewrite, I do not have the original code for Illusion, nor do I own it. It was heavily skidded from Raven B3 and RavenWeave, and I don't want to keep up the trend of inbreeding Raven.

## Usage
- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/Syz66/Illusion/releases/tag/latest)
- Add to mods folder (.minecraft/mods)
- Launch (RShift for ClickGui)
  - Use `.help` in-game for help

---

## Credits (for when I do skid)
- ClickGui: Lemon Click Gui, I just want the client to be usable while I work on my own :D
